# pgt-pangenome
Protegenomics analysis based on Pangenome references

The aim of this project is to search normal tissue proteomics datasets to identify novel proteins using the latest genome assemblies published via the PanGenome project.

Main Tasks:
- Compare scores and FDR for known canonical and novel canonical peptides, check distributions, etc (est. due date Sep 25)
- Revisit FDR caluclations and significant measures (est. due date Oct 2)
- Analyze the novel canonical, locations, gene types, other evidence for expression, etc (est. due date Oct Oct 9)
- Draft manuscript layout and sections (est. due date Oct 13)
